numb, a, command, numb, the, respons, mad, to, the, command, as, far, as, the, command, goe, command, can, be, legitim, such, as, the, pop, ord, cathol, to, not, eat, meat, on, friday, or, they, can,

think, that, they, ar, clear, cont, to, the, tradit, teach, of, the, pap, and, the, best, interest, of, the, church, in, fact, someon, who, find, himself, in, thi, situ, has, a, duty, to, resist, now, what, is, the, stant, of, rom, on, al, thi, wel, if, you, read, the, holy, fath, 's, motu, proprio, eccles, dei, you, can, find, out, it, 's, the, definit, docu, on, the, subject, a, motu, proprio,

problem, was, a, misunderstand, of, the, nat, of, tradt, both, ar, confus, i, fail, to, see, the, log, of, the, pop, 's, point, as, far, as, the, episcop, consecr, go, i, read, an, interest, artic,

constitut, a, schismatic, act, just, excommun, und, the, cur, cod, of, canon, law, but, my, problem, with, thi, is, thi, accord, to, the, tradit, theolog, of, holy, ord, episcop, consecr, doe, not, conf, jurisdict, it, on, conf, the, pow, of, ord, the, abl, to, confect, the, sacra, jurisdict, must, be, confer, by, someon, els, with, the, pow, to, conf, it, such, as, the, pop, the, socy, bishop, know, the, tradit, theolog, quit, wel, tak, gre, pain, to, avoid, any, pret, of, jurisdict, ov, anyon, they, simply, conf, thos, sacra, that, requir, a, bishop, the, si, si, no, no, artic, was,

conf, jurisdict, i, lent, the, artic, to, a, friend, unfortun, so, ca, n't, tel, you, mor, i, believ, they, quot, the, new, cod, of, canon, law, in, support, of, thi, ide, the, pop, 's, think, on, thi, point, remain, a, gre, puzzl, to, me, ther, 's, no, way, ther, is, a, schism, accord, to, tradit, cathol, theolog, so, why, doe, the, pop, think, thi, as, far, as, the, point, regard, the, nat, of, tradit, goe, here's, the, pass, in, quest, the, root, of, thi, schismatic, act, can, be, discern, in, an, incomplet, and, contradict, not, of, tradt, incomplet, becaus, it, doe, not, tak, sufficy, into, the, account, the, liv, charact, of, tradit, which, as, the, second, vat, council, clear, taught, com, from, the, apostl, and, progress, in, the, church, with, the, help, of, the, holy, spirit,

the, pop, the, argu, being, that, eith, cas, is, sufficy, to, prov, that, archbishop, lefebvr, must, be, wrong, becaus, he, disagr, with, them, thi, is, weak, to, say, the, least, it, would, hav,
