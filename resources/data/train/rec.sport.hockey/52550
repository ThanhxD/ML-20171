i, was, going, to, mak, but, i, think, the, reason, is, lemieux, had, a, numb, point, season, and, was, the, first, non, gretzky, to, win, the, hart, and, ross, sint, numb, peopl, turn, out, to, watch, him, play, i, wil, grant, that, a, star, lik, mario, wil, draw, fan, ev, if, the, team, suck, but, thi, is, short, term, on, i, stil, do, not, think, the, attend, increas, wil, last, unless, the, team, is, a, win, competit, improv, but, kick, on, pittsburgh, was, stil, get, bet, so, peopl, continu, to, support, them, if, they, sud, drop, to, say, numb, point, you, 'd, hav, kne, surgery,

bound, team, a, doubl, of, attend, occ, in, numb, numb, from, the, prevy, year, an, increas, from, numb, point, to, numb, point, is, not, going, to, do, that, the, ar, of, mario, lemieux, is, what, did, it, you, can, giv, the, credit, to, mario, sint, he, deserv, it, but, my, point, is, that, it, was, n't, mario, himself, but, it, was, the, expect, of, thing, to, com, i, e, a, win, team, that, he, cre, by, being, the, next, gre, hockey, superst, and, bef, anybody, jump, in, and, say, i, 'm, nit, pick, and, mint, word, go, back, and, read, from, wher, thi, thread, start, it, might, help, to, think, about, what, would, go, through, a, fan, 's, mind, who, sud, found, an, interest, in, mario, and, the, pen, was, it, gee, mario, lemieux, is, amaz, i, 'll, go, watch, him, play, or, was, it, gee, now, we, 've, got, a, kick, ass, guy, on, our, sid, i, 'll, go, watch, him, play, i, think, it, was, the, lat, simil, thing, hap, in, l, a, bef, gretzky, 's, ar, about, numb, per, gam, aft, const, sellout, they, ar, stil, sel, out, every, gam, despit, show, littl, or, no, improv, sint, gretzky, 's, first, year, ther, how, do, you, explain, it, peopl, ar, going, to, see, gretzky, they, certain, ar, n't, going, to, see, a, win, they, haven't, got, a, win, they, 've, had, much, bet, team, in, their, past, hist, than, they, cur, hav, yet, they, did, n't, draw, as, wel, then, i, do, n't, think, thi, is, acc, the, ticket, sel, but, peopl, do, n't, go, to, the, gam, i, think, thi, thread, has, already, been, discuss, season, ticket, hold, in, la, do, n't, alway, us, their, ticket, so, in, effect, aft, the, king, init, success, follow, gretzky, 's, ar, numb, to, numb, point, sam, sourc, and, correspond, attend, jump, ther, has, been, an, effect, drop, in, attend, ev, though, ticket, sal, may, not, hav, chang, much, wheth, or, not, the, king, ar, a, 'winner, ', is, deb, i, claim, that, sint, gretzky, 's, ar, they, hav, at, the, very, least, been, competit, i, also, claim, that, mcnall, has, mad, a, stupid, mov, in, try, to, reassembl, the, oil, dynasty, but, that, 's, anoth, story, and, includ, on, becaus, i, do, n't, lik, mcnall, anyway, mcnall, did, do, som, heavy, market, around, gretzky, and, that, undoubt, was, also, respons, for, the, attend, and, merchand, sal, etc, but, as, i, said, when, the, king, hav, been, in, ther, littl, tailspin, ov, the, past, coupl, of, year, ther, hav, been, empty, seat, at, the, for, ev, if, the, ticket, wer, sold, i, think, in, the, cas, of, a, lemieux, or, gretzky, the, play, can, transcend, win, as, the, maj, draw, pow, for, the, short, term, imo, although, i, think, that, it, 's, inevit, that, the, team, wil, improv, with, a, play, such, as, lemieux, or, gretzky, simply, becaus, they, mak, peopl, around, them, bet, but, win, sur, as, hel, help, wel, at, least, we, ar, in, ful, agr, her, thi, doe, not, mak, rog, 's, point, any, mor, valid, but, the, jet, aren't, so, ar, you, say, rog, has, ev, had, a, valid, point, could, n't, resist, get, a, hug, jump, in, produc, yet, they, ar, get, a, hug, jump, in, attend, thi, is, due, to, the, emerg, of, teemu, selan, they, hav, the, numb, th, best, record, in, hockey, it, sur, as, hel, is, n't, becaus, they, ar, win, ye, but, they, ar, doing, no, wors, than, last, year, i, think, the, sam, typ, of, reason, i, apply, to, a, new, pittsburgh, fan, apply, to, al, the, extr, peopl, show, up, at, winnipeg, gam, it, 's, difficult, to, predict, but, do, you, think, that, if, the, jet, miss, the, playoff, next, season, that, in, the, year, aft, they, wil, maintain, their, attend, level, i, sery, doubt, it, becaus, in, that, cas, the, expect, of, an, improv, team, would, be, gon, with, or, without, selan, i, did, provid, the, exampl, of, rocket, ismail, and, the, toronto, argonaut, of, the, cfl, did, you, leav, it, out, becaus, you, do, n't, know, much, about, the, cfl, if, that, 's, the, cas, then, fair, enough, but, if, it, is, n't, the, cas, then, i, 'm, cury, to, hear, yo, expl
